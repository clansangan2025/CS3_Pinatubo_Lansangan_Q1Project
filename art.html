            <p>A deformed building against a golden backdrop. 
            How does this<br> make you feel? Personally, I think this image evokes 
                the feeling of being lost.</br> </p>

                <img src = "violethaze.jpg" width = "440px" height = "440px">
                <p>This is my personal favorite. Something about it feels so comforting.<br>
                    The yellow block of light amongst the dark colors feels like you're the only
                    one awake, </br>surfing the web late at night.
                    Feels like staying up late talking to your friends. <br>How does this make you feel?</br>

                <p>This one feels like taking a swim in acid. There's something so vile about it.
                    It's like an <br>abandoned resort and the pool hasn't been cleaned for years, so all this dreck and sludge
                    swirl about. Sounds fun! How does this make you feel?</br>

            <div class = "face"> 
                <img src = "scaryface.jpg" width = "440px" height = "440px">
                <p>Why is it looking at me!? This image evokes sheer dread
                    in me. I feel<br> like I would collapse under its dissecting stare.
                    Can you handle it? How does this make you feel?</br>

                <img src = "greektemple.jpg" width = "440px" height = "440px">
                <p>Ah, back to ancient times. Maybe an oracle is waiting for me inside. 
                    <br>Inhaling smoke and foreseeing whatever happens to me. Should I ask it? 
                    Should I take</br> a peek at what awaits me?
                    How does this make you feel?

                <p>A tree beside a small mass of white. <br>A tiny mountain, perhaps? A portal?</br>
                    Why is it all glitchy and pixelated?
                    How does this make you feel?
